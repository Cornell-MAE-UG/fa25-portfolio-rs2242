## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/6.png" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}


My name is {{ site.name }}. I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell with hands on experience across aerospace systems, data driven analysis, and technical storytelling.

A lot of my work lives at the intersection of engineering and impact. On the technical side, I have built tools and analyses around aviation and flight operations data, and I enjoy taking messy real world inputs and turning them into something clean, explainable, and useful. On the people side, I run The Ursa Majors Group, where I build STEM programs and conversations that help students see what’s possible and how to get there.

This portfolio is a snapshot of what I have been building, what I have learned while building it, and how I think as an engineer.
